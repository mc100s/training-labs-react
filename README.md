# Module 3 | React

<!-- 
Maxence feedback:
- Would be good to start with JS Recap of knowledge that are going to be reused: class, inheritence, super, immutability, this, binding, .slice, .fill ...
- I have started a little to fast for the students
- The concept of JSX is hard to understand for them
- They really like the small "mob-exercices"
